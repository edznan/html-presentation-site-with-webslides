                                Education would begin at a young age with study of Arabic and the Quran,
                                either at home or in a primary school, which was often attached to a 
                                mosque. Some students would then proceed to training in tafsir 
                                (Quranic exegesis) and fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), 
                                which was seen as particularly important. Education focused on 
                                memorization, but also trained the more advanced students to participate 
                                as readers and writers in the tradition of commentary on the studied texts. 
                                It also involved a process of socialization of aspiring scholars, 
                                who came from virtually all social backgrounds, into the ranks of the ulema.

                                For the first few centuries of Islam, educational settings were entirely informal, 
                                but beginning in the 11th and 12th centuries, the ruling elites began to establish 
                                institutions of higher religious learning known as madrasas in an effort to secure 
                                support and cooperation of the ulema. Madrasas soon multiplied throughout the 
                                Islamic world, which helped to spread Islamic learning beyond urban centers and to 
                                unite diverse Islamic communities in a shared cultural project.

                                The formal attestation of educational attainment, ijaza, was granted by a particular
                                scholar rather than the institution, and it placed its holder within a genealogy of 
                                scholars, which was the only recognized hierarchy in the educational system.

                        recognized hierarchy in the educational system. While formal studies in 
                        madrasas were open only to men, women of prominent urban families were commonly 
                        educated in private settings and many of them received and later issued ijazas 
                        in hadith studies, calligraphy and poetry recitation. Working women learned 
                        religious texts and practical skills primarily from each other, though they also 
                        received some instruction together with men in mosques and private homes.

                        Madrasas were devoted principally to study of law, but they also offered other 
                        subjects such as theology, medicine, and mathematics. The madrasa complex 
                        usually consisted of a mosque, boarding house, and a library. 
                        It was maintained by a waqf (charitable endowment), which paid salaries of 
                        professors, stipends of students, and defrayed the costs of construction and
                        maintenance. The madrasa was unlike a modern college in that it lacked a 
                        standardized curriculum or institutionalized system of certification.

                        Muslims distinguished disciplines inherited from pre-Islamic civilizations, 
                        such as philosophy and medicine, which they called "sciences of the ancients" 
                        or "rational sciences", from Islamic religious sciences. Sciences of the former 
                        type flourished for several centuries, and their transmission formed part of 
                        the educational framework in classical and medieval Islam. In some cases, 
                        they were supported by institutions such as the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, 
                        but more often they were transmitted informally from teacher to student.

                        The University of Al Karaouine, founded in 859 AD, is listed in The Guinness 
                        Book Of Records as the world's oldest degree-granting university. 
                        The Al-Azhar University was another early university (madrasa). 
                        The madrasa is one of the relics of the Fatimid caliphate. 
                        The Fatimids traced their descent to Muhammad's daughter Fatimah and named 
                        the institution using a variant of her honorific title Al-Zahra (the brilliant). 
                        Organized instruction in the Al-Azhar Mosque began in 978.

                                Juristic thought gradually developed in study circles, where independent 
                                scholars met to learn from a local master and discuss religious topics.
                                At first, these circles were fluid in their membership, but with time 
                                distinct regional legal schools crystallized around shared sets of methodological principles.
                                As the boundaries of the schools became clearly delineated, the authority of their 
                                doctrinal tenets came to be vested in a master jurist from earlier times, 
                                who was henceforth identified as the school's founder.
                                In the course of the first three centuries of Islam, all legal schools came 
                                to accept the broad outlines of classical legal theory, according 
                                to which Islamic law had to be firmly rooted in the Quran and hadith.

                    <p>
                        The classical theory of Islamic jurisprudence elaborates how scriptures should be 
                        interpreted from the standpoint of linguistics and rhetoric. It also comprises methods 
                        for establishing authenticity of hadith and for determining when the legal force of a 
                        scriptural passage is abrogated by a passage revealed at a later date. In addition 
                        to the Quran and sunnah, the classical theory of Sunni fiqh recognizes two other 
                        sources of law: juristic consensus (ijmaʿ) and analogical reasoning (qiyas).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It therefore studies the application and limits of analogy, as well as the value 
                        and limits of consensus, along with other methodological principles, 
                        some of which are accepted by only certain legal schools. 
                        This interpretive apparatus is brought together under the rubric of 
                        ijtihad, which refers to a jurist's exertion in an attempt to arrive at 
                        a ruling on a particular question. The theory of Twelver Shia jurisprudence 
                        parallels that of Sunni schools with some differences, such as recognition of 
                        reason (ʿaql) as a source of law in place of qiyas and extension of the notion 
                        of sunnah to include traditions of the imams.

                        The body of substantive Islamic law was created by independent jurists (muftis). 
                        Their legal opinions (fatwas) were taken into account by ruler-appointed judges 
                        who presided over qāḍī's courts, and by maẓālim courts, which were controlled by 
                        the ruler's council and administered criminal law.

                        Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Ibn Rushd (Averroes) played a major role in interpreting 
                        the works of Aristotle, whose ideas came to dominate the non-religious thought 
                        of the Christian and Muslim worlds. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 
                        translation of philosophical texts from Arabic to Latin in Western Europe 
                        "led to the transformation of almost all philosophical disciplines in the medieval 
                        Latin world". The influence of Islamic philosophers in Europe was particularly strong 
                        in natural philosophy, psychology and metaphysics, though it also influenced the study 
                        of logic and ethics.

                        Avicenna argued his "Floating man" thought experiment concerning self-awareness, in which a man prevented of sense experience by being blindfolded and free falling would still be aware of his existence.

                            the law of sines is attributed; he wrote his The Book of Unknown Arcs 
                            of a Sphere in the 11th century. This formula relates the lengths of 
                            the sides of any triangle, rather than only right triangles, to the sines of its angles. 
                            According to the law:

                        Islamic art makes use of geometric patterns and symmetries in many of its art forms, 
                        notably in girih tilings. These are formed using a set of five tile shapes, namely a 
                        regular decagon, an elongated hexagon, a bow tie, a rhombus, and a regular pentagon. 
                        All the sides of these tiles have the same length; and all their angles are multiples 
                        of 36° (π/5 radians), offering fivefold and tenfold symmetries. The tiles are decorated 
                        with strapwork lines (girih), generally more visible than the tile boundaries. 
                        In 2007, the physicists Peter Lu and Paul Steinhardt argued that girih from the 
                        15th century resembled quasicrystalline Penrose tilings. Elaborate geometric zellige tilework 
                        is a distinctive element in Moroccan architecture. Muqarnas vaults are three-dimensional 
                        but were designed in two dimensions with drawings of geometrical cells.

                        in the history of scientific method, 
                        particularly in his approach to experimentation, and has been described as the

                        Avicenna made rules for testing the effectiveness of drugs, including that the effect 
                        produced by the experimental drug should be seen constantly or after many repetitions, 
                        to be counted. The physician Rhazes was an early proponent of experimental medicine 
                        and recommended using control for clinical research. 
                        He said: "If you want to study the effect of bloodletting on a condition, divide the patients 
                        into two groups, perform bloodletting only on one group, watch both, and compare the results."

                                In about 964 AD, the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, writing in his Book of 
                                Fixed Stars, described a "nebulous spot" in the Andromeda constellation, the first 
                                definitive reference to what we now know is the Andromeda Galaxy, the nearest spiral 
                                galaxy to our galaxy. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi invented a geometrical technique called a 
                                Tusi-couple, which generates linear motion from the sum of two circular motions to replace 
                                Ptolemy's problematic equant. The Tusi couple was later employed in Ibn al-Shatir's geocentric 
                                model and Nicolaus Copernicus' heliocentric Copernican model although 
                                it is not known who the intermediary is or if Copernicus rediscovered the technique independently.

                        Alhazen played a role in the development of optics. One of the prevailing theories of vision 
                        in his time and place was the emission theory supported by Euclid and Ptolemy, where sight 
                        worked by the eye emitting rays of light, and the other was the Aristotelean theory that 
                        sight worked when the essence of objects flows into the eyes. Alhazen correctly argued that 
                        vision occurred when light, traveling in straight lines, reflects off an object into the eyes. 
                        Al-Biruni wrote of his insights into light, stating that its velocity must be immense when 
                        compared to the speed of sound.

                                In the cardiovascular system, Ibn al-Nafis in his Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon was 
                                the first known scholar to contradict the contention of the Galen School that blood could pass 
                                between the ventricles in the heart through the cardiac inter-ventricular septum that 
                                separates them, saying that there is no passage between the ventricles at this point. 
                                Instead, he correctly argued that all the blood that reached the left ventricle did so 
                                after passing through the lung. He also stated that there must be small communications, or pores, 
                                between the pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein, a prediction that preceded the discovery of 
                                the pulmonary capillaries of Marcello Malpighi by 400 years.

                                In the nervous system, Rhazes stated that nerves had motor or sensory functions, 
                                describing 7 cranial and 31 spinal cord nerves. 
                                He assigned a numerical order to the cranial nerves from the optic to the hypoglossal nerves. 
                                He classified the spinal nerves into 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 3 sacral, and 3 coccygeal nerves. 
                                He used this to link clinical signs of injury to the corresponding location of lesions in the nervous system.

                        the archives were detailed and vast during their time. All letters that were received 
                        or sent on behalf of the governing bodies were copied, archived and noted for filing. 
                        The position of the archivist was seen as one that had to have a high level of devotion

                            are the Syro-Egyptian establishments of the 12th and 13th centuries.

                            had 6 hospitals by the 15th century and Córdoba alone had 50 major hospitals,

                            Decrees by caliphs required examinations to license pharmacists 
                            and pharmacy students were trained in a combination of classroom exercises coupled with 
                            day-to-day practical experiences with drugs. To avoid conflicts of interest, doctors 
                            were banned from owning or sharing ownership in a pharmacy.

                            Apart from the Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates, navigable rivers were uncommon in the Middle East, 
                            so transport by sea was very important. Navigational sciences were highly developed, 
                            making use of a rudimentary sextant (known as a kamal). When combined with detailed maps of 
                            the period, sailors were able to sail across oceans rather than skirt along the coast. 
                            Muslim sailors were also responsible for reintroducing large, three-masted merchant 
                            vessels to the Mediterranean.[citation needed] The name caravel may derive from an earlier 
                            Arab boat known as the qārib.

                            Many Muslims went to China to trade, and these Muslims began to have a great economic 
                            influence on the country. Muslims virtually dominated the import/export industry 
                            by the time of the Sung dynasty (960–1279). Muhammad al-Idrisi created the Tabula 
                            Rogeriana, the best maps of the middle ages, used by various explorers such as 
                            Christopher Columbus and Vasco Da Gama for their voyages in America and India.

                    <p>The Arabs of Al-Andalus exerted a large impact on Spanish agriculture, 
                        including the restoration of Roman-era aqueducts and irrigation channels, 
                        as well as the introduction of new technologies such as the acequias 
                        (derived from the qanats of Persia) and Persian gardens (such as at the Generalife). 
                        In Spain and Sicily, the Arabs introduced crops and foodstuffs from the Persia and 
                        India such as rice, sugarcane, oranges, lemons, bananas, saffron, carrots, apricots and 
                        eggplants, as well as restoring cultivation of olives and pomegranates from Greco-Roman times. 
                        The Palmeral of Elche in southern Spain is a UNESCO World Heritage site that is emblematic 
                        of the Islamic agricultural legacy in Europe.
